# libairtable

libairtable is a client for Airtable, built on libevent-async.

Currently supports the [public REST API](https://airtable.com/api). I've written support for the [metadata API](https://airtable.com/api/meta) as well but have not yet tested it.

See AirtableClient.hh for information on how to use the AirtableClient object, and AirtableCLI.cc for some usage examples.
